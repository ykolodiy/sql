First we’ll login to the MySQL server from the command line with the following command:

mysql -u root -p

In this case, I’ve specified the user root with the -u flag, and then used the -p flag so MySQL prompts for a password. Enter your current password to complete the login.

Now switch to the appropriate MySQL database with the following command:

use mysql;

Next we’ll update the password for all MySQL users with the name root. Be sure to replace your_new_password with the actual new password:

update user set password=PASSWORD('your_new_password') where User='root';

Note: You can change the password for any user with the above command. Simply specify that user’s username in place of root.
Finally, reload the privileges:

flush privileges;

Now you’re all set to exit MySQL!

quit
